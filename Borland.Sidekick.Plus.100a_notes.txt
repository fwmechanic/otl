  Desperate to get this going on Linux (since GV2 is not really THAT great).

  First, `apt install dosbox`
  mkdir -p ~/dos/SKPLUS

  dosbox config: edit ~/.dosbox/dosbox-*.conf

  # to get near fullscreen size (on 1080p screen):
  [sdl] windowresolution=1600x1000
  [sdl] output=opengl
  [render] frameskip=0
  [render] aspect=true
  [render] scaler=normal3x
  [dosbox] machine=svga_s3
  # for SKP, which ISTR used FCB's for some file accesses
  [dos] fcbs=16,8

  To start SKPLUS (or my customized version, SKPOTL.EXE):

  [autoexec]
  # Lines in this section will be run at startup.
  # You can put your MOUNT lines here.
  mount c ~/dos
  c:
  cd SKPLUS
  # /G is "run on non-resident (non-TSR) mode" flag !!!
  SKPOTL.EXE /G
  exit


  Downloaded floppy images from https://winworldpc.com/product/sidekick/plus

  It *appears* that you only need to copy the contents of all 3 floppy images
  into the "install dir" (e.g. C:\SKPLUS).  I used INSTALL.EXE to copy the
  first floppy(image)s files there, but manually copied the other 2
  floppy(image)s worth using the COPY command.  From there (C:\SKPLUS) I was able to run
  INSTALL.EXE to customize the application in place (or have it update or
  generate a customized .EXE file in C:\SKPLUS).

  Gotcha: hit F2 to save current file: if dirty, a red error message "Unable
  to create file" appears in ULC.
  Fix: I seem to have fixed this by nav'ing somewhere in the menu structure
  and disabling "create .BAK file" (presumably, when saving the OTL file).

  Manual refs: (I already had): Borland.Sidekick.Plus.Owners.Handbook.1988.pdf
  pg 335: Ch 15: "Designing your own SideKick Plus" (running INSTALL.EXE
                 post-"install" to create an entirely new .EXE file
                 customized to your requirements):

          You can specify a new .EXE filename to contain the customized
          version; I elected SKPOTL.EXE

          I chose:
            80x50 mode
            data buffer = 100KB (recommended if running 80x50 mode)
            ONLY Outlook (outline) app resident (and no others)
            video adapter = "IBM Compatible"

          This resulted in SKPOTL.EXE a 200.2KB file (vs SKPLUS.EXE, a 393.7KB file)

          That's really all I care about.

  pg 349: Ch 16: "Changing SideKick Plus from DOS"
          `SKPLUS.EXE /G` is how you run in nonresident mode.
